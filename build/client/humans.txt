Atlas Grotesk - Atlas Grotesk is a clean and fresh sans serif with relatively long ascenders but short descenders. This allows the typeface to feel spacious and comfortable for extended reading even when set with tight leading. The aesthetic of Atlas was inspired in large part by the sans serifs of the 1950s, specifically Dick Dooijesâ€™s Mercator, released by the Amsterdam Type Foundry in 1957. However, while Atlas takes most of its stylistic cues from Europe, its vertical proportions and contrast have more in common with American gothics, and it sets more like Trade Gothic or Franklin Gothic than like Neue Haas Grotesk or Univers.

Operator Mono - Operator Mono is in the family of fixed-width typefaces, with a broader range of weights than a typical typewriter face, and an italic that positively shines in code. Its more editorial companion is the natural-width Operator family, which offers the voice of typewriting but none of the compromises.
