Atlas Grotesk (from https://type.today/en/atlas_grotesk) - Atlas was originally designed as a corporate typeface for Munich Re, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies. This typeface deliberately avoided contemporary trends in corporate type design in favor of the clear, optimistic tone of Dutch Modernism. The client produces hundreds of publications, reports, and other documents each year. They required a new typeface capable of maintaining clarity in often complicated typographical situations with a suitably well-considered range of weights. The new typeface also had to be economic in setting, saving space over the previous corporate face and saving significant amounts of paper in the process. Authored by Susana Carvalho, Kai Bernau, Christian Schwartz (Commercial Type), and Ilya Ruderman (CSTM Fonts).

Operator Mono (from https://typography.com/fonts/operator/design-notes) - The Operator typeface was designed by Andy Clymer with Jonathan Hoefler in 2016. A highly personal exploration of the ‘monospace’ aesthetic, in which all letterforms are designed to share a common width, Operator draws inspiration from a range of fixed-width technologies including typewriters and vinyl tape embossers. The family includes both the fixed-width Operator Mono, designed for writing code, and the natural-width Operator that relaxes the rules while preserving the style. Contributions from Jordan Bell and Troy Leinster.

Cedarville Cursive (from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cedarville+Cursive/about) - Cedarville Cursive was designed by Kimberly Geswein. It is based on the handwriting of a cheerful young preschool teacher. From her love of her Cedarville University alma mater to her passion for her students, she is a delightful, dependable person. Her handwriting contains that same blend of fun appeal with restrained discipline. Many handwritten script fonts have large flourishes, but this is a more simple script, similar to authentic daily handwriting.
